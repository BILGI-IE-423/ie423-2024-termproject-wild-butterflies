# Proposal : Understanding relationship between deforestation and deaths due to air pollution

## Abstract 
In this project, we will analyze the relationship between deforestation and air pollution-related deaths. In this project, we aim to create relationship information that can be examined and used to prevent the consequences of deforestation and deaths that may occur in the future, with the results obtained through regressions and machine learning techniques.

## Introduction


Global warming and deforestation are some of the topics that have become popular in the last century. Deforestation poses a significant danger not only to animals but also to humans. With deforestation, air pollution increases, which causes health problems for people. This project also creates a useful information set to be used in examining deaths due to these problems.

## Objectives


- Analyzing the relationship between deforestation and air pollution-related deaths by country

- Develop regression models to forecast future deaths due to deforestation
